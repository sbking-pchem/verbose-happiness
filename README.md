Code for plotting the dispersions and fields of plasmonic modes. Solves for dispersion for given energy for any 2-, 3-, and 4-layer stacks and plot the resulting electric fields. 

* Fields and Dispersions:
    Generates plots for figures shown in MXene Perspectives
* Library of of Analytical Field:
    Contains all functions for solving and plotting fields
