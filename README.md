Code for plotting the dispersions and fields of photonic modes (both plasmonic and waveguide) in thin films. Given material dielectrics and an input energy, the model solves for the dispersion for any 2-, 3-, and 4-layer stack and plots the resulting electric fields. 

* Fields and Dispersions:
    Generates plots for figures shown in MXene Perspectives paper
* Library of of Analytical Field Models:
    Contains all functions for solving and plotting fields
